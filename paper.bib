Berechnung werden viele unterschiedliche Tageswerte als Input benötigt, die zum Teil nicht gemessen und daher abgeleitet werden
müssen. Die Tagesmitteltemperatur und der mittlere Dampfdruck des Tages werden mithilfe der Minimum- und Maximumtemperatur der
Luft berechnet, das Tagesmittel der Windgeschwindigkeit wird auf 2 m heruntergerechnet, außerdem wird das Tagesmittel der relativen
Feuchte verwendet und die Strahlungsbilanz wird mithilfe der Globalstrahlung als Inputgröße berechnet. Die Globalstrahlung wurde anstelle
der Sonnenscheindauer genommen, da sie die wirklichen Strahlungsverhältnisse genauer wiedergibt als die über die Sonnenscheindauer,
die auch am frühen Morgen oder Abend bei geringer Strahlung hoch sein kann},

	abstract = {Core Ideas TERENO-NE investigates the regional impact of global change. We facilitate interdisciplinary geo-ecological research. Our data sets comprise monitoring data and geoarchives. We are able to bridge time scales from minutes to millennia. The Northeast German Lowland Observatory (TERENO-NE) was established to investigate the regional impact of climate and land use change. TERENO-NE focuses on the Northeast German lowlands, for which a high vulnerability has been determined due to increasing temperatures and decreasing amounts of precipitation projected for the coming decades. To facilitate in-depth evaluations of the effects of climate and land use changes and to separate the effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers in the region, six sites were chosen for comprehensive monitoring. In addition, at selected sites, geoarchives were used to substantially extend the instrumental records back in time. It is this combination of diverse disciplines working across different time scales that makes the observatory TERENO-NE a unique observation platform. We provide information about the general characteristics of the observatory and its six monitoring sites and present examples of interdisciplinary research activities at some of these sites. We also illustrate how monitoring improves process understanding, how remote sensing techniques are fine-tuned by the most comprehensive ground-truthing site DEMMIN, how soil erosion dynamics have evolved, how greenhouse gas monitoring of rewetted peatlands can reveal unexpected mechanisms, and how proxy data provides a long-term perspective of current ongoing changes.},

	abstract = {The grand challenge confronting agriculture is the development of technologies for sustainable intensification of crop production systems to feed the estimated future human population of 9 to 10 billion. It is thought that crop production must be increased by 60 to 100\% by the year 2050 to meet these nutritional needs. Crop production systems that yield more food of higher nutritional content are needed that at the same time have a diminished impact on the environment. Prior agricultural intensification was through substantial use of fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigation all at significant environmental cost. As a part of Sustainable Agriculture, next-generation, on cropping systems that couple biologically based technologies (plant-beneficial microbes, cover crops) and precision agriculture need to be developed to decrease fertilizer, pesticide, and water inputs. Over the past two decades, Information Technology has been the disruptive force in industries by driving out market inefficiencies through automation and better decision support tools that require the inclusion of both the citizens and consumers in the process. Like all industries, Agriculture has not been immune to the constant disruptions over the past century. However, recent advances in the computing infrastructure, sensor technology, big data and advanced algorithms ( suggest that a major disruption or paradigm shift is on the horizon, leading to opportunities for sustainable agriculture entering the mainstream. Specifically, solutions based on these new technologies will be needed for mass transfer of genomic and other genetic data for development of these advanced crop cultivars, and for the management of agronomic data for the development of these next-generation production systems. Geospatial solutions based on imagery, IoT, AI, mobile data collection, etc. will be critical for the operation of precision agriculture systems where intelligent application of resource inputs are applied at precise geo-specific field locations based on crop need. Finally, solutions will be needed to allow immediate feedback from digital farm communities regarding the performance of these new cropping systems; speeding their development. Here we describe a “system of systems” approach to building a scientific network that integrates the scientific and farming communities, based on a Geoinformatics cloud framework.},

	abstract = {In the view of increasing water demands in agriculture, efficient water use is a key factor in potato production. The aim of this study was to compare two deficit (80\% and 90\%) and one abundant (120\%) gun sprinkler irrigation levels with the longtime used irrigation level of a farmer (100\%). Irrigation was supplied during the 2021 growing season on a loamy sand site in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania, Germany. Yield and tuber quality of the high-amylopectin potato (HAPP) variety “Waxy/Henriette” were assessed in a three-grade tuber size distribution. Five economic indicators were used to assess the suitability of the investigated irrigation levels to secure economic responses. Yield and starch yield did not significantly differ between the 90\% (561.1 dt ha−1 and 102.0 dt ha−1) and the 100\% irrigation levels (559.1 dt ha−1 and 102.3 dt ha−1), with total production increasing by 2.0 dt ha−1 and starch production decreasing by 0.4 dt ha−1 at the 90\% irrigation level. Tuber lesions decreased the economic responses at all irrigation levels. Potentially, 87,469 m3 of irrigation water (125.8 m3 ha−1) could have been saved on the loamy sand starch potato sites of the local farm (695.3 ha) in 2021.},

	abstract = {Water is considered one of the vital natural resources and factors for performing short- and long-term agricultural practices on Earth. Meanwhile, globally, most of the available freshwater resources are utilized for irrigation purposes in agriculture. Currently, many world regions are facing extreme water shortage problems, which can worsen if not managed properly. In the literature, numerous methods and remedies are used to cope with the increasing global water crises. The use of precision irrigation water-saving systems (PISs) for efficient water management under climate change is one of them and is a highly recommended approach by researchers. It can mitigate the adverse effects of changing climate and help enhance water use efficiency, crop yield, and environmental footprints. Thus, the present study aimed to comprehensively examine and review PISs, focusing on their development, implementation, and positive impacts on sustainable water management. In addition, we searched the literature using different online search engines and reviewed and summarized the main results of the previously published papers on PISs. We discussed the traditional irrigation method and its modernization for enhancing water use efficiency, PIS monitoring and controlling, architecture, data sharing communication technologies, the role of artificial intelligence for irrigation water-saving, and the future prospects of the PIS. Based on the brief literature review, the present study concluded that the future of PISs seems bright, driven by the need for efficient irrigation water management systems, technological advancements, and increasing environmental awareness. As the water scarcity problem intensifies due to climate change and population growth, the PIS is poised to play a critical role in optimizing and modernizing water usage, increasing water use efficiency, and reducing environmental footprints, thus ensuring sustainable agriculture development.},

	abstract = {Non-destructive real-time monitoring of leaf water status is important for precision irrigation practice to increase water productivity and reduce its use. To this end, we tested and validated a novel leaf sensor (Leaf Water Meter, LWM), based on the photon attenuation during the passage of the light through the leaf, to monitor plant water status. Four woody species were subjected to multiple cycles of dehydration and re-hydration, and the signals recorded by the LWM were compared with classical measurements of plant water relations (relative water content and water potential). A good agreement between the signals recorded by LWM sensor and the destructive measurements, throughout the repeated water stress and rewatering cycles, was found across all species. These results demonstrate that LWM sensor is a sensitive, non-destructive and easy-to-handle device to reliably monitor in continuous fashion leaf water status. In conclusion, this sensor may be considered a promising tool for smart irrigation scheduling in precision agriculture context to decrease water wastage in light of global change and increasing conflicts over water demand.},
