	abstract = {CONTEXT Climate models project higher temperatures and a substantial net water deficit during the summer months over Germany until the end of the 21st century. The agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to changing weather and climate conditions. OBJECTIVE In this study, we examine the role of irrigation for potato yields as a climate change adaptation measure in Northeast Lower Saxony (Germany). The region represents the largest irrigated area in Germany and is one of the main growing areas of potatoes. METHODS We develop a statistical multivariate regression model to investigate whether regional climate and irrigation data at the monthly and county level are suitable to describe potato yield variability from 1978 to 2018. Irrigation is estimated based on the climatic water balance and crop water demand. These estimates are calibrated against irrigation data from local agencies to account for realistic monthly water withdrawals. We analyze future yield changes based on climate model projections for the 21st century and different irrigation scenarios. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We find that the potato yield will decrease significantly by 18\% on average until 2050 with climate projection uncertainty of ±6.4\% under the high emission scenario RCP 8.5 and without irrigation. Irrigation at current levels could compensate for about 54\% of these yield losses. Doubling the amount of irrigation minimizes yield losses by as much as 80\%. Under the low (middle) emission scenario RCP 2.6 (RCP 4.5), potato yield are projected to decrease moderately by 4.5\% ± 3.4\% (5.4\% ± 2.8\%) with irrigation at current levels. We show that the yield losses mainly originate from higher temperatures during the summer. Our analysis indicates that the capacity of irrigation to minimize yield losses is limited. Strengthening climate change mitigation efforts may be more effective in preventing yield losses. However, the effect of elevated CO2 might buffer the high yield losses, especially in RCP 8.5. SIGNIFICANCE The studies supports farmers and decision makers in assessing future risks in potato yields. It can guide policymakers in allocating economic resources to cope with climate change.},

	abstract = {By example of a region in Northern Germany (County of Uelzen), this study investigates whether climate change is likely to require adaption of agricultural practices such as irrigation in Central Europe. Due to sandy soils with low water retention capacity and occasional insufficient rainfall, irrigation is a basic condition for agricultural production in the county of Uelzen. Thus, in the framework of the comprehensive research cluster Nachhaltiges Landmanagement im Norddeutschen Tiefland (NaLaMa-nT), we investigated whether irrigation might need to be adapted to changing climatic conditions. To this end, results from regionalised climate change modelling were coupled with soil- and crop-specific evapotranspiration models to calculate potential amounts of irrigation to prevent crop failures. Three different runs of the climate change scenario RCP 8.5 were used for the time period until 2070.},

	abstract = {In Northwestern Europe, Germany, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Belgium constitute the biggest five potato producers, with total potato crop production around 60\% of EU-28 production before Brexit. Soil and climate conditions are highly favourable for potato growth in this region. Production is under driving forces of (i) the potato processing industry, particularly in Belgium; (ii) the innovation for fresh potato in the UK, France and Germany; (iii) the leadership of Germany and the Netherlands for starch potato; and (iv) the dominance of the Netherlands for seed production. Based on an industrial agri-food production system, the region has the highest potato yield levels worldwide and developed relevant trade networks for export of seed, fresh and processed potato products in and outside Europe. Conventional and intensive potato production is widespread over the region, whilst organic production started to develop in Germany and France. Whether the coming decades will be as successful as the last ones for sustainable potato production will depend on how the sector and stakeholders of the whole potato value-chain will overcome new issues and challenges. These are mainly soil quality and health conservation, consequences of climate change, increasing bans on the use of plant protection products, tightening environmental standards, food waste reduction and increasing trade tensions hampering the flow of potatoes around the world. After a detailed description of the potato production in the region, this paper contains a SWOT analysis aiming to identify potential solutions to overcome environmental, technical, economic, political and societal issues in the region for sustainable potato production in the coming years and decades.},

The investigated crops are winter wheat, spring barley, maize, winter rapeseed, potato, sugar beet, pulses and sunflower. The period considered is 1976–2005. The research was executed at NUTS2 level. Maize and sugar beet were the crops least affected by changing temperature and global radiation patterns. For the other crops the simulated potential yield remained stable in the majority of regions, while decreasing trends in simulated potential yields prevailed in the remaining regions. The changes appear in a geographical pattern. In Italy and southern central Europe, temperature and radiation change effects are more severe than elsewhere, in these areas potential crop yields of more than three crops significantly decreased. In the UK and some regions in northern Europe the yield potential of various crops increased. In a next step the national yield statistics were analyzed. For a large majority of the countries the yield increases of wheat, barley and to a lesser extent rapeseed are leveling off. Several explanations could be given, however, as the simulated yield potential for these crops decreased in various regions, the changing temperature and radiation patterns may also contribute to the diminishing yield increases or to the stagnation. In more than 50\% of the investigated countries the maize, potato and sugar beet yields continue to increase. This can be attributed to improving production techniques, new crop varieties, sometimes in combination with an improving climatic potential. In some regions in northern Europe, yields continue to increase.},

However, SD method has more advantages than SSD method, which has difficulties in replacement and higher system cost. Irrigation levels resulted in significant difference in both years on yield and its components. Water stress significantly affected the yield and yield parameters of early potato production. Water deficiency more than 33\% of the irrigation requirement could not be suggested. Water use efficiency (WUE) of SD irrigation methods had generally higher values than SSD irrigation methods. Treatment I33 gave maximum irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) for both years. SSD irrigation method did not provide significant advantage on yield and WUE, compared to SD irrigation in early potato production under experimental conditions.

The aim of this study was to compare two deficit (80\% and 90\%) and one abundant (120\%) gun sprinkler irrigation levels with the longtime used irrigation level of a farmer (100\%). Irrigation was supplied during the 2021 growing season on a loamy sand site in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania, Germany. Yield and tuber quality of the high-amylopectin potato (HAPP) variety “Waxy/Henriette” were assessed in a three-grade tuber size distribution. Five economic indicators were used to assess the suitability of the investigated irrigation levels to secure economic responses. Yield and starch yield did not significantly differ between the 90\% (561.1 dt ha−1 and 102.0 dt ha−1) and the 100\% irrigation levels (559.1 dt ha−1 and 102.3 dt ha−1), with total production increasing by 2.0 dt ha−1 and starch production decreasing by 0.4 dt ha−1 at the 90\% irrigation level. Tuber lesions decreased the economic responses at all irrigation levels. Potentially, 87,469 m3 of irrigation water (125.8 m3 ha−1) could have been saved on the loamy sand starch potato sites of the local farm (695.3 ha) in 2021.},

Normalized crop canopy temperature, termed crop water stress index (CWSI), was proposed over 40 years ago as an irrigation management tool but has experienced limited adoption in production agriculture. Development of generalized crop-specific upper and lower reference temperatures is critical for implementation of CWSI-based irrigation scheduling. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate data-driven models for predicting the reference canopy temperatures needed to compute CWSI for sugarbeet and wine grape. Reference canopy temperatures for sugarbeet and wine grape were predicted using machine learning and regression models developed from measured canopy temperatures of sugarbeet, grown in Idaho and Wyoming, and wine grape, grown in Idaho and Oregon, over five years under full and severe deficit irrigation. Lower reference temperatures (TLL) were estimated using neural network models with Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies exceeding 0.88 and root mean square error less than 1.1\&deg;C. The relationship between TLL minus ambient air temperature and vapor pressure deficit was represented with a linear model that maximized the regression coefficient rather than minimized the sum of squared error. The linear models were used to estimate upper reference temperatures that were nearly double the values reported in previous studies. A daily CWSI, calculated as the average of 15 min CWSI values between 13:00 and 16:00 MDT for sugarbeet and between 13:00 and 15:00 local time for wine grape, were well correlated with irrigation events and amounts. There was a significant (p \&lt; 0.001) linear relationship between the daily CWSI and midday leaf water potential of Malbec and Syrah wine grapes, with an R2 of 0.53. The data-driven models developed in this study to estimate reference temperatures enable automated calculation of the CWSI for effective assessment of crop water stress. However, measurements taken under conditions of wet canopy or low solar radiation should be disregarded as they can result in irrational values of the CWSI.},

We are able to bridge time scales from minutes to millennia. The Northeast German Lowland Observatory (TERENO-NE) was established to investigate the regional impact of climate and land use change. TERENO-NE focuses on the Northeast German lowlands, for which a high vulnerability has been determined due to increasing temperatures and decreasing amounts of precipitation projected for the coming decades. To facilitate in-depth evaluations of the effects of climate and land use changes and to separate the effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers in the region, six sites were chosen for comprehensive monitoring. In addition, at selected sites, geoarchives were used to substantially extend the instrumental records back in time. It is this combination of diverse disciplines working across different time scales that makes the observatory TERENO-NE a unique observation platform. We provide information about the general characteristics of the observatory and its six monitoring sites and present examples of interdisciplinary research activities at some of these sites. We also illustrate how monitoring improves process understanding, how remote sensing techniques are fine-tuned by the most comprehensive ground-truthing site DEMMIN, how soil erosion dynamics have evolved, how greenhouse gas monitoring of rewetted peatlands can reveal unexpected mechanisms, and how proxy data provides a long-term perspective of current ongoing changes.},

In 2008, the German Helmholtz Association took up this challenge and launched the German research infrastructure TERrestrial ENvironmental Observatories (TERENO). The aim of TERENO is the establishment and maintenance of a network of observatories as a basis for an interdisciplinary and long-term research program to investigate the effects of global environmental change on terrestrial ecosystems and their socio-economic consequences. State-of-the-art methods from the field of environmental monitoring, geophysics, remote sensing, and modeling are used to record and analyze states and fluxes in different environmental disciplines from groundwater through the vadose zone, surface water, and biosphere, up to the lower atmosphere. Over the past 15 years we have collectively gained experience in operating a long-term observing network, thereby overcoming unexpected operational and institutional challenges, exceeding expectations, and facilitating new research. Today, the TERENO network is a key pillar for environmental modeling and forecasting in Germany, an information hub for practitioners and policy stakeholders in agriculture, forestry, and water management at regional to national levels, a nucleus for international collaboration, academic training and scientific outreach, an important anchor for large-scale experiments, and a trigger for methodological innovation and technological progress. This article describes TERENO's key services and functions, presents the main lessons learned from this 15-year effort, and emphasizes the need to continue long-term integrated environmental monitoring programmes in the future.},

The development of such advisory systems is highly dependent upon the availability of timely updated crop canopy parameters and weather forecasts several days in advance, at low operational costs. This study presents a methodology for forecasting ETc, based on crop parameters retrieved from multispectral images, data from ground weather sensors, and air temperature forecasts. Crop multispectral images are freely provided by recent satellite missions, with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Meteorological services broadcast air temperature forecasts with lead times of several days, at no subscription costs, and with high accuracy. The performance of the proposed methodology was applied at 18 sites of the Campania region in Italy, by exploiting the data of intensive field campaigns in the years 2014–2015. ETc measurements were forecast with a median bias of 0.2 mm, and a median root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.75 mm at the first day of forecast. At the 5th day of accumulated forecast, the median bias and RMSE become 1 mm and 2.75 mm, respectively. The forecast performances were proved to be as accurate and as precise as those provided with a complete set of forecasted weather variables.},

However, uncertainties of the generalized dual crop coefficient (Kc) method of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 can contribute to crop evapotranspiration estimates that are substantially different from actual crop evapotranspiration. Similarities between the crop coefficient curve and a satellite-derived vegetation index showed potential for modeling a crop coefficient as a function of the vegetation index. Therefore, the possibility of directly estimating the crop coefficient from satellite reflectance of a crop was investigated. The Kc data used in developing the relationship with NDVI were derived from back-calculations of the FAO-56 dual crop coefficients procedure using field data obtained during 2007 from representative US cropping systems in the High Plains from AmeriFlux sites. A simple linear regression model ( ) is developed to establish a general relationship between a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from a moderate resolution satellite data (MODIS) and the crop coefficient (Kc) calculated from the flux data measured for different crops and cropping practices using AmeriFlux towers. There was a strong linear correlation between the NDVI-estimated Kc and the measured Kc with an r2 of 0.91 and 0.90, while the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for Kc in 2006 and 2007 were 0.16 and 0.19, respectively. The procedure for quantifying crop coefficients from NDVI data presented in this paper should be useful in other regions of the globe to understand regional irrigation water consumption.},

The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that LAI, leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of a potato crop can be estimated by vegetation indices for the first time using Sentinel-2 satellite images. In 2016 ten plots of 30 × 30 m were designed in a potato field with different fertilization levels. During the growing season approximately 10 daily radiometric field measurements were used to determine LAI, LCC, and CCC. These radiometric determinations were extensively calibrated against LAI2000 and chlorophyll meter (SPAD, soil plant analysis development) measurements for potato crops grown in the years 2010–2014. Results for Sentinel-2 showed that the weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI) using bands at 10 m spatial resolution can be used for estimating the LAI (R2 of 0.809; root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.36). The ratio of the transformed chlorophyll in reflectance index and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) showed to be a good linear estimator of LCC at 20 m (R2 of 0.696; RMSEP of 0.062 g·m−2). The performance of the chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) at 10 m spatial resolution was slightly worse (R2 of 0.656; RMSEP of 0.066 g·m−2) compared to TCARI/OSAVI. Finally, results showed that the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen) was an accurate and linear estimator of CCC at 10 m (R2 of 0.818; RMSEP of 0.29 g·m−2). Results for CIgreen were better than for the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge, R2 of 0.576, RMSE of 0.43 g·m−2). Our results show that Sentinel-2 bands at 10 m spatial resolution are suitable for estimating LAI, LCC, and CCC, avoiding the need for red-edge bands that are only available at 20 m. This is an important finding for applying Sentinel-2 data in precision agriculture.},

However, quantifying how uncertainty in soil-moisture estimates lead to irrigation inefficiencies or economic losses has not been explicitly studied. We develop a framework that combines a crop simulation model with a rule-based irrigation decision-making algorithm to assess the impact of soil-moisture uncertainty on irrigation use and farm profits. We apply this modelling framework to a case study of irrigated maize production in Nebraska, United States, a region where improvements in agricultural water productivity are at the forefront of water-policy debates. We consider two main sources of uncertainty that result in a divergence between the farmers’ perception of soil-water content and the true water status, namely errors in the knowledge of soil texture and measurement of daily soil-water flux inflows and outflows. Even for very large errors in both soil-texture and water-flux measurements, impacts on water use and profits were marginal (11 ha-mm increase and \$27 ha–1 decrease, respectively). In contrast, farmers’ choice of irrigation strategy had a much larger impact on water use and profits than uncertainty in soil-moisture information used to implement that strategy. Our findings show that near-optimal irrigation decisions can be made without perfect soil-moisture information. This conclusion suggests that providing farmers with improved irrigation scheduling recommendations – utilizing crop-water models and optimization techniques – would have a larger impact on water-use efficiency than simply providing farmers with technologies to more accurately monitor soil-moisture conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract In recent years, remote sensing satellites, including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), continuously monitor SM of the earth. However, the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed SM is insufficient for some hydrological applications. In this paper, a data-driven model is proposed based on a hybrid approach called artificial neural network kriging (ANNK) to capture the interaction between SM and ancillary data (AD), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), altitude, slope, Antecedent Moisture Condition, AMC (5-day cumulative precipitation), and daily air temperature (DAT)/land surface temperature (LST). By co-regionalization of the estimated SM from the ANNK and SMAP 36-km product, SM in any part of the study area is estimated more accurately and on a finer resolution (1-km). Finally, through a linear relationship between in-situ SM with the up-to-date AD including AMC (previous 5-day cumulative precipitation), LST or DAT, slope, NDVI, and the downscaled satellite SM, the soil moisture estimates are adjusted by also adding an error term. Estimation of the final SM product in terms of the Unbiased Root Mean Square Error of less than 0.04 m3/m3 meets the accuracy requirements of the SMAP SM retrieval. Moreover, the results of SM validation show that the proposed technique has a potential for real-time SM estimations in developing areas.},

	abstract = {L-band passive microwave remote sensing has evolved over the past decade to estimate soil moisture (SM) and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD). Novel Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) schemes and model parameterizations are proposed to achieve this goal. In this work, we attempt to characterize errors and uncertainties that propagate from RTMs and their parameters while retrieving SM and VOD from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data. Three RTMs are considered, including a zeroth order model (τ-ω model) and two first order models (First order RTM and 2-Stream Emission model (2S-EM)). Surface roughness (h; characterizes undulations on soil surface) and single scattering albedo (ω; accounts for the scattering of emissions due to vegetation structure) are the two parameters (of RTMs) considered. SM and VOD are retrieved concurrently using a multi-temporal RTM inversion scheme. Errors and uncertainty contributions are determined using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) approach. To assess the role of land cover conditions on error and uncertainties in retrievals, ten reference sites are chosen to represent various biomes. Initially, brightness temperatures are simulated by varying RTMs and their parameters to determine their sensitivity. The SM and VOD retrievals are compared with reference datasets, and the performance is found to be acceptable. Error decomposition analysis indicates RTMs and their parameters (h and ω) induce noticeable and significant error in SM and VOD retrievals. Errors contributions due to the above factors are more prominent in VOD retrievals compared to SM. However, the uncertainty contributions indicate minimal influence of RTMs and their parameters on SM retrievals. The ω parameter followed by the choice of RTM have significant contributions to the uncertainty in the VOD retrievals. The h parameter resulted in significant uncertainties in VOD retrievals under sparsely vegetated regions. The results are used to comment on the suitability of each of the three RTMs and the model parameterization design that could alleviate the issue of errors and uncertainties in concurrent retrievals of SM and VOD. These inferences shall contribute towards developing robust multi-parameter retrieval algorithms.},

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a promising proximal soil sensing technique to estimate soil moisture at intermediate scale and high temporal resolution. However, the signal shows complex and non-unique response to all hydrogen pools near the land surface, providing some challenges for soil moisture estimation in practical applications. Aims of the study were 1) to assess the uncertainty of CRNS as a stand-alone approach to estimate volumetric soil moisture in cropped field 2) to identify the causes of this uncertainty 3) and possible improvements. Two experimental sites in Germany were equipped with a CRNS probe and point-scale soil moisture network. Additional monitoring activities were conducted during the crop growing season to characterize the soil-plant systems. This data is used to identify and quantify the different sources of uncertainty (factors). An uncertainty analysis, based on Monte Carlo approach, is applied to propagate these uncertainties to CRNS soil moisture estimations. In addition, a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol’ method is performed to identify the most important factors explaining this uncertainty. Results show that CRNS soil moisture compares well to the soil moisture network when these point-scale values are weighted to account for the spatial sensitivity of the signal and other sources of hydrogen (lattice water and organic carbon) are added to the water content. However, the performance decreases when CRNS is considered as a stand-alone method to retrieve the actual (non-weighted) volumetric soil moisture. The support volume (penetration depth and radius) shows also a considerable uncertainty, especially in relatively dry soil moisture conditions. Four of the seven factors analyzed (the vertical soil moisture profile, bulk density, incoming neutron correction and the calibrated parameter N0) were found to play an important role. Among the possible improvements identified, a simple correction factor based on vertical point-scale soil moisture profiles shows to be a promising approach to account for the sensitivity of the CRNS signal to the upper soil layers.},

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of three CWSI models (CWSIe - empirical, CWSIt - theoretical, CWSIh - hybrid) for crop water stress monitoring in an experimental field for potato crops in Northern Germany. Irrigation experiments with three treatments (optimum-OP, reduced-RD and no) were conducted in the summer of 2018 and 2019. Continuous canopy temperatures (Tc) for OP and RD irrigation treatments together with meteorological measurements were used to derive CWSI from the different models. Additionally, Visible/near infrared (VNIR) and Thermal Infrared (TIR) drone images were collected on several days during the growing season to create CWSI maps. The different CWSI models were correlated with volumetric soil water content (θ) measurements for comparison and relationships were established between CWSI and θ for prediction. Results showed that CWSI accurately estimates soil water content under atmospheric conditions similar to those in semi-arid regions. The predictive performance of different CWSI models were fairly good (R2 =0.57–0.63) (situation in 2019). CWSIe and CWSIh performed better than CWSIt. CWSI-θ relations calibrated in one year effectively predicted θ in another year with errors of 1.2–2.2\% absolute soil water content. CWSIh could be a promising alternative to the traditional CWSI as it combines aspects of CWSIe (empirical upper limit) and of CWSIt (theoretical lower limit) which has advantages for operational use. Finally, the drone-based CWSI and θ maps (derived from the developed CWSI- θ relations) captured well the applied irrigation patterns and could help to decide when to irrigate and how much water to apply.},

	abstract = {Irrigation has traditionally been managed as uniform applications where an entire field receives the same depth of water. Motivation to improve current irrigation practices has led to different approaches utilizing remotely-sensed images to inform variable rate irrigation management. This study conducted in 2019 and 2020 implemented the Spatial EvapoTranspiration Modeling Interface (SETMI), a remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration (ET) and water balance model, for managing variable rate irrigation of a maize and soybean field. This model tracked soil water content through the estimation of daily ET and tracking of various water fluxes entering and leaving a field. SETMI was used in two different irrigation treatments informed using Planet satellite (SETMI-SAT) and unmanned aerial system (UAS, SETMI-UAS) remotely-sensed images. A uniform irrigation approach managed by a professional crop consultant and a non-irrigated approach were used as the baseline in comparing irrigation management approaches. The irrigation treatments were evaluated on dry grain yield, gross irrigation, actual ET, deep percolation, change in soil water content, and water productivity. The uniform irrigation approach managed by the crop consultant applied the highest irrigation in 2019 and 2020 for maize (2019: 155 mm, 2020: 213 mm) and soybean (2019: 124 mm; 2020: 183 mm) while the SETMI irrigation treatments applied less irrigation for maize (2019: 131, 132 mm; 2020: 154, 140 mm) and soybean (2019: 116, 94 mm; 2020: 154, 175 mm). Maize yield was highest for the uniform irrigation approach in 2019 (14.9 Mg ha−1) and 2020 (13.3 Mg ha−1). The highest soybean yield was produced by the SETMI-SAT irrigation management approach in 2019 (5.0 Mg ha−1) and 2020 (4.8 Mg ha−1). Significant differences (p-value {\textless} 0.05) in applied irrigation between the uniform and SETMI irrigation management approaches were observed while there were no significant differences in dry grain yield for both maize and soybean in 2019 and 2020. At least one of the SETMI irrigation treatments produced higher crop, irrigation, and ET water productivity values in comparison to those produced by the uniform irrigation treatment for all crop-years. A post-season analysis was completed using the SETMI-UAS and SETMI-SAT treatments to evaluate the accuracy of estimated rootzone soil water depletion provided by SETMI. Rootzone depletion calculated from neutron probe volumetric soil water content measurements were compared to the modeled depletion from the SETMI-UAS and SETMI-SAT treatments. The 2020 modeled and measured depletion comparison produced better agreement resulting in a root mean squared error (RMSE) {\textless} 17 mm compared to 2019 (RMSE {\textless} 27 mm). The VRI center pivot malfunctioned during the 2019 season which caused unresolved discrepancies between actually applied irrigation and what the system was programmed to apply. The VRI system was fixed before the 2020 season.},

The extent and location of irrigated areas vary in both methodology and scale. One major reason for discrepancies is the choice of spatial resolution. This study evaluates the influence of spatial resolution on the mapped extent and spatial patterns of irrigation using an NDVI threshold approach with Sentinel-2 and operational PROBA-V data. The influence of resolution on irrigation mapping was analyzed in the USA, China and Sudan to cover a broad range of agricultural systems by comparing results from original 10 m Sentinel-2 data with mapped coarser results at 20 m, 40 m, 60 m, 100 m, 300 m, 600 m and 1000 m and with results from PROBA-V. While the mapped irrigated area in China is constant independent of resolution, it decreases in Sudan (−29\%) and the USA (−48\%). The differences in the mapping result can largely be explained by the spatial arrangement of the irrigated pixels at a fine resolution. The calculation of landscape metrics in the three regions shows that the Landscape Shape Index (LSI) can explain the loss of irrigated area from 10 m to 300 m (r {\textgreater} 0.9).},

The development and distribution of remote sensing applications is also growing. The availability of extensive spatial and temporal data—enhanced by satellite remote sensing and open-source policies—provides an attractive opportunity to collect, analyze and use agricultural data at the farm scale and beyond. The division of individual fields into zones of differing yield potential (management zones (MZ)) is the basis of most offline and map-overlay precision farming applications. In the process of delineation, manual labor is often required for the acquisition of suitable images and additional information on crop type. The authors therefore developed an automatic segmentation algorithm using multi-spectral satellite data, which is able to map stable crop growing patterns, reflecting areas of relative yield expectations within a field. The algorithm, using RapidEye data, is a quick and probably low-cost opportunity to divide agricultural fields into MZ, especially when yield data is insufficient or non-existent. With the increasing availability of satellite images, this method can address numerous users in agriculture and lower the threshold of implementing precision farming practices by providing a preliminary spatial field assessment.},

	abstract = {Estimating the number and size of irrigation center pivot systems (CPS) from remotely sensed data, using artificial intelligence (AI), is a potential information source for assessing agricultural water use. In this study, we identified two technical challenges in the neural-network-based classification: Firstly, an effective reduction of the feature space of the remote sensing data to shorten training times and increase classification accuracy is required. Secondly, the geographical transferability of the AI algorithms is a pressing issue if AI is to replace human mapping efforts one day. Therefore, we trained the semantic image segmentation algorithm U-NET on four spectral channels (U-NET SPECS) and the first three principal components (U-NET principal component analysis (PCA)) of ESA/Copernicus Sentinel-2 images on a study area in Texas, USA, and assessed the geographic transferability of the trained models to two other sites: the Duero basin, in Spain, and South Africa. U-NET SPECS outperformed U-NET PCA at all three study areas, with the highest f1-score at Texas (0.87, U-NET PCA: 0.83), and a value of 0.68 (U-NET PCA: 0.43) in South Africa. At the Duero, both models showed poor classification accuracy (f1-score U-NET PCA: 0.08; U-NET SPECS: 0.16) and segmentation quality, which was particularly evident in the incomplete representation of the center pivot geometries. In South Africa and at the Duero site, a high rate of false positive and false negative was observed, which made the model less useful, especially at the Duero test site. Thus, geographical invariance is not an inherent model property and seems to be mainly driven by the complexity of land-use pattern. We do not consider PCA a suited spectral dimensionality reduction measure in this. However, shorter training times and a more stable training process indicate promising prospects for reducing computational burdens. We therefore conclude that effective dimensionality reduction and geographic transferability are important prospects for further research towards the operational usage of deep learning algorithms, not only regarding the mapping of CPS.},

Estimating biomass, nitrogen content or crop yield can improve farm management and optimize precision agriculture applications. A vast amount of data is made available both as map material and from space. However, it is up to the user to select the appropriate data for a particular problem. Without the appropriate knowledge, this may even entail an economic risk. This study therefore investigates the direct relationship between satellite data from six different optical sensors as well as different soil and relief parameters and yield data from cereal and canola recorded by the thresher in the field. A time series of 13 years is considered, with 947 yield data sets consisting of dense point data sets and 755 satellite images. To answer the question of how well the relationship between remote sensing data and yield is, the correlation coefficient r per field is calculated and interpreted in terms of crop type, phenology, and sensor characteristics. The correlation value r is particularly high when a field and its crop are spatially heterogeneous and when the correct phenological time of the crop is reached at the time of satellite imaging. Satellite images with higher resolution, such as RapidEye and Sentinel-2 performed better in comparison with lower resolution sensors of the Landsat series. The additional Red Edge spectral band also has advantage, especially for cereal yield estimation. The study concludes that there are high correlation values between yield data and satellite data, but several conditions must be met which are presented and discussed here.},

	abstract = {Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.},

Precision agriculture (PA), as a way to realize the accurate management and decision support of agricultural production processes using modern information technology, is becoming an effective method of solving these challenges. In particular, the combination of remote sensing technology and machine learning algorithms brings new possibilities for PA. However, there are relatively few comprehensive and systematic reviews on the integrated application of these two technologies. For this reason, this study conducts a systematic literature search using the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases and analyzes the integrated application of remote sensing technology and machine learning algorithms in PA over the last 10 years. The study found that: (1) because of their varied characteristics, different types of remote sensing data exhibit significant differences in meeting the needs of PA, in which hyperspectral remote sensing is the most widely used method, accounting for more than 30\% of the results. The application of UAV remote sensing offers the greatest potential, accounting for about 24\% of data, and showing an upward trend. (2) Machine learning algorithms displays obvious advantages in promoting the development of PA, in which the support vector machine algorithm is the most widely used method, accounting for more than 20\%, followed by random forest algorithm, accounting for about 18\% of the methods used. In addition, this study also discusses the main challenges faced currently, such as the difficult problems regarding the acquisition and processing of high-quality remote sensing data, model interpretation, and generalization ability, and considers future development trends, such as promoting agricultural intelligence and automation, strengthening international cooperation and sharing, and the sustainable transformation of achievements. In summary, this study can provide new ideas and references for remote sensing combined with machine learning to promote the development of PA.},

	abstract = {Agricultural irrigation, which accounts for almost 90\% of the world's water consumption, is essential to water resource management, especially in the face of climate change. Predicting future demand for irrigation water is imperative for water security. A thorough understanding of these dynamics is needed to guide effective water management strategies. The emergence of precision farming tools marks a fundamental change in farmers’ decision-making. Satellite remote sensing can be used to monitor crop water conditions on a large scale, offering a long-term perspective, enabling agricultural authorities to create customized irrigation programs in response to regional climatic trends. However, the figures reveal alarming problems, such as pressure on water tables, pollution of agricultural waters, increasing use of wastewater, and the proliferation of water-hungry crops. Remote sensing, combined with numerical data, offers a proactive approach to solving these challenges, enabling continuous monitoring of water resources, identifying sources of pollution, and adjusting irrigation practices to minimize water wastage. This approach is emerging as a more sustainable solution in the complex context of climate change.},

	abstract = {Water is considered one of the vital natural resources and factors for performing short- and long-term agricultural practices on Earth. Meanwhile, globally, most of the available freshwater resources are utilized for irrigation purposes in agriculture. Currently, many world regions are facing extreme water shortage problems, which can worsen if not managed properly. In the literature, numerous methods and remedies are used to cope with the increasing global water crises. The use of precision irrigation water-saving systems (PISs) for efficient water management under climate change is one of them and is a highly recommended approach by researchers. It can mitigate the adverse effects of changing climate and help enhance water use efficiency, crop yield, and environmental footprints. Thus, the present study aimed to comprehensively examine and review PISs, focusing on their development, implementation, and positive impacts on sustainable water management. In addition, we searched the literature using different online search engines and reviewed and summarized the main results of the previously published papers on PISs. We discussed the traditional irrigation method and its modernization for enhancing water use efficiency, PIS monitoring and controlling, architecture, data sharing communication technologies, the role of artificial intelligence for irrigation water-saving, and the future prospects of the PIS. Based on the brief literature review, the present study concluded that the future of PISs seems bright, driven by the need for efficient irrigation water management systems, technological advancements, and increasing environmental awareness. As the water scarcity problem intensifies due to climate change and population growth, the PIS is poised to play a critical role in optimizing and modernizing water usage, increasing water use efficiency, and reducing environmental footprints, thus ensuring sustainable agriculture development.},

The possible consequences of global warming lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed at saving water usage in the irrigation process have increased over the years. Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation systems are very expensive, making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system. However, manufacturers are currently offering low-cost sensors that can be connected to nodes to implement affordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture monitoring. Due to the recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can be applied in the development of these systems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart irrigation systems. We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions.

	abstract = {The demand for freshwater resources has increased in recent times and has been exacerbated by escalating global population and increasing drought indices in the world’s agricultural zones. Irrigated agriculture is inevitably a wasteful water user that has deprived other sectors of the scarce resource. Improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is therefore crucial for sustainable agricultural production to thrive. There is potential to improve water use efficiency through smart irrigation systems, especially with the advent of wireless communication technologies, monitoring systems, and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation scheduling. This paper reviews state-of-the-art smart monitoring and irrigation control strategies that have been used in recent years for irrigation scheduling. From the literature review, closed-loop irrigation control strategies are efficient than open-loop systems which do not cater for uncertainties. It is argued that combining soil-based, plant, and weather-based monitoring methods in a modelling environment with model predictive control can significantly improve water use efficiency. This review shall help researchers and farmers to choose the best irrigation monitoring and control strategy to improve irrigation scheduling in open field agricultural systems.},

In 2008, the German Helmholtz Association took up this challenge and launched the German research infrastructure TERrestrial ENvironmental Observatories (TERENO). The aim of TERENO is the establishment and maintenance of a network of observatories as a basis for an interdisciplinary and long-term research program to investigate the effects of global environmental change on terrestrial ecosystems and their socio-economic consequences. State-of-the-art methods from the field of environmental monitoring, geophysics, remote sensing, and modeling are used to record and analyze states and fluxes in different environmental disciplines from groundwater through the vadose zone, surface water, and biosphere, up to the lower atmosphere. Over the past 15 years we have collectively gained experience in operating a long-term observing network, thereby overcoming unexpected operational and institutional challenges, exceeding expectations, and facilitating new research. Today, the TERENO network is a key pillar for environmental modeling and forecasting in Germany, an information hub for practitioners and policy stakeholders in agriculture, forestry, and water management at regional to national levels, a nucleus for international collaboration, academic training and scientific outreach, an important anchor for large-scale experiments, and a trigger for methodological innovation and technological progress. This article describes TERENO's key services and functions, presents the main lessons learned from this 15-year effort, and emphasizes the need to continue long-term integrated environmental monitoring programmes in the future.},

	abstract = {Estimating evapotranspiration (ET) has been one of the most critical research areas in agriculture because of water scarcity, the growing population, and climate change. The accurate estimation and mapping of ET are necessary for crop water management. Traditionally, researchers use water balance, soil moisture, weighing lysimeters, or an energy balance approach, such as Bowen ratio or eddy covariance towers to estimate ET. However, these ET methods are point-specific or area-weighted measurements and cannot be extended to a large scale. With the advent of satellite technology, remote sensing images became able to provide spatially distributed measurements. However, the spatial resolution of multispectral satellite images is in the range of meters, tens of meters, or hundreds of meters, which is often not enough for crops with clumped canopy structures, such as trees and vines. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can mitigate these spatial and temporal limitations. Lightweight cameras and sensors can be mounted on the UAVs and take high-resolution images. Unlike satellite imagery, the spatial resolution of the UAV images can be at the centimeter-level. UAVs can also fly on-demand, which provides high temporal imagery. In this study, the authors examined different UAV-based approaches of ET estimation at first. Models and algorithms, such as mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC), the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model, and machine learning (ML) are analyzed and discussed herein. Second, challenges and opportunities for UAVs in ET estimation are also discussed, such as uncooled thermal camera calibration, UAV image collection, and image processing. Then, the authors share views on ET estimation with UAVs for future research and draw conclusive remarks.},

While many technologies have been developed for measuring crop water use in crop management studies, rarely have these techniques been applied at the scale of breeding plots. The objective was to develop a high-throughput methodology for quantifying water use in a cotton breeding trial at Maricopa, AZ, USA in 2016 and 2017, using evapotranspiration (ET) measurements from a co-located irrigation management trial to evaluate the approach. Approximately weekly overflights with an unmanned aerial system provided multispectral imagery from which plot-level fractional vegetation cover ( f c ) was computed. The f c data were used to drive a daily ET-based soil water balance model for seasonal crop water use quantification. A mixed model statistical analysis demonstrated that differences in ET and CWUE could be discriminated among eight cotton varieties ( p {\textless} 0 . 05 ), which were sown at two planting dates and managed with four irrigation levels. The results permitted breeders to identify cotton varieties with more favorable water use characteristics and higher CWUE, indicating that the methodology could become a useful tool for breeding selection.},

	abstract = {Accurate, automated cloud and cloud shadow detection is a key component of the processing needed to prepare optical satellite imagery for scientific analysis. Many existing cloud detection algorithms rely on temperature information to identify clouds, making detection difficult for imagers that lack a thermal band, like Sentinel-2. To get maximum benefit from Sentinel-2 products it is critical to understand which algorithms best identify clouds and their shadows in images. We examined the relative performance of five different cloud-masking algorithms (Sen2Cor, MAJA, LaSRC, Fmask and Tmask) in 6 Sentinel-2 scenes (28 total images) distributed across the Eastern Hemisphere. Expanding on these comparisons, we tested ensemble approaches to improve results. We tested three ensemble approaches to cloud and shadow classification based on the outputs of the five initial algorithms using the cloud masks in: (1) a majority prediction model; (2) a random forests model; and (3) a conditional logic model. Accuracy assessments show a trade-off between omission and commission errors in cloud detection for individual algorithms across all sites, and some algorithms are better at detecting either clouds or cloud shadows. No single algorithm outperforms the others for both clouds and shadows. Aggregating the results from multiple algorithms produces fewer undetected clouds and higher overall accuracy than any single algorithm, with as high as 2.7\% improvement over the top-performing algorithm, suggesting an ensemble approach may be the most useful for processing of Sentinel-2 data.},

	abstract = {The PlanetScope CubeSat constellation is providing unprecedented global coverage, visible to near infrared, atmospherically corrected, 3 m imagery. The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12 month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90\% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2 h and 13 min, 1 h and 30 min, and 1 h and 50 min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6 km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12 month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9\% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non-coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12 months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3 h, and 9.6\%, 71.8\%, and 88.4\% of the land points had average revisit intervals {\textless}24 h, {\textless}36 h, and {\textless} 48 h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25 s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15 days; 95.4\% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit {\textless}180 s, and 89.1\% had a maximum revisit {\textless}480 h (20 days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as “standard” or as “test” quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as “standard” at each land grid point over the 12 months was 78.14\%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10 day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12 study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December–February) and spring (March–May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12 months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution.},

The results show that conventional inorganic fertilization provided the highest yield (8618 kg ha⁻1), while yields from OMF showed a comparable performance to traditional fertilizers, indicating their potential for sustainable agriculture. PlanetScope data demonstrated moderate accuracy in predicting canopy cover (R2 = 0.68), crop yield (R2 = 0.54), and grain quality parameters such as protein content (R2 = 0.49), starch (R2 = 0.56), and hectoliter weight (R2 = 0.51). However, its coarser resolution limited its ability to capture finer treatment-induced variability. MicaSense, despite its higher spatial resolution, performed poorly in predicting crop components, with R2 values below 0.35 for yield and protein content.

	abstract = {The impact of climate change on potato cultivation in Montenegro was assessed. Three scenarios (A1B, A1Bs and A2) for 2001–2030, 2071–2100 and 2071–2100, respectively, were generated by a regional climate model and compared with the baseline period 1961–1990. The results indicated an increase of temperature during the summer season from 1.3 to 4.8 °C in the mountain region and from 1 to 3.4 °C in the coastal zone. The precipitation decreased between 5 and 50\% depending on the scenario, region and season. The changes in temperature and precipitation influenced phenology, yield and water needs. The impact was more pronounced in the coastal areas than in the mountain regions. The growing season was shortened 13.6, 22.9 and 29.7 days for A1B, A1Bs and A2, respectively. The increase of irrigation requirement was 4.0, 19.5 and 7.3 mm for A1B, A1Bs and A2, respectively. For the baseline conditions, yield reduction under rainfed cultivation was lower than 30\%. For A1B, A1Bs and A2 scenarios, yield reductions were 31.0 ± 8.2, 36.3 ± 11.6 and 34.1 ± 10.9\%, respectively. Possible adaptation measures include shifting of production to the mountain (colder) areas and irrigation application. Rainfed cultivation remains a viable solution when the anticipation of sowing is adopted.},

However, long-term projections are complex and merit further investigation due to uncertainties in climate data, differential responses of crops to climate and elevated atmospheric CO2, and adaptive agricultural management. We conducted factor-control simulation experiments using the process-based CropSyst model and investigated the contribution of each of these factors. Five major irrigated crops in the Columbia Basin Project area of the USA Pacific Northwest were selected as a case study and fifteen general circulation models (GCM) under two representative concentration pathways (RCP) were used as the climate forcing. Results indicated a wide range in ETc change, depending on the time frame, crop type, planting dates, and CO2 assumptions. Under the 2090s RCP8.5 scenario, ETc changes were crop-specific: +14.3\% (alfalfa), +8.1\% (potato), −5.1\% (dry bean), −8.1\% (corn), and −12.5\% (spring wheat). Future elevated CO2 concentrations decreased ETc for all crops while earlier planting increased ETc for all crops except spring wheat. Changes in reference ET (ETo) only partially explains changes in ETc because crop responses are an important modulating factor; therefore, caution must be exercised in interpreting ETo changes as a proxy for ETc changes.},

	abstract = {Water scarcity is a prevailing problem that constrains crop production in many regions worldwide. The application of deficit irrigation strategy is a reliable approach, which may contribute to some degree to overcome the problem of global water scarcity. A two-year study was conducted to assess the effects of timing and severity of the deficit irrigation on yield, water productivity (WP) and yield response factor (Ky) of potato. In 2018, the treatments included: 100\% (V100) of crop evapotranspiration (ET), 50\% (V50–100) reduction of ET until end of tuber initiation, 50\% (V100–50) reduction of ET during the middle of tuber bulking up to maturity stage and no irrigation following plant establishment (V0). In 2019, the treatments included: V100 and V0 as in the previous year, deficit irrigation at 50\% of ET (DI50), partial root-zone drying (PRD) at 75 or 50\% of ET applied during the whole growing season. Deficit irrigation at a reduced rate of 50\% of ET crop during the first part of the crop cycle (V50–100) strongly depressed total yield while limiting irrigation water for the last part of the crop cycle (V100–50) did not induce significant losses in yield. Deficit irrigation positively affected water productivity, especially with V100–50, suggesting that water efficiency was closely related to the growth stage than to the available water in the soil. In 2019, reducing water to 75\% of V100 with PRD75 did not significantly affect tuber yield, while the further reduction in the irrigation water with PRD50 or DI50 resulted in a substantial yield decrease. Although the same amount of water was applied to both treatments, the reduction in yield was 41\% with DI50 compared to 28\% with PRD50, where the latter proved to be superior in maintaining yield. However, an appreciable increment in WP was observed with both PRD treatments unless the water stress is too high to depress the yield. The sensitivity of potato to water stress was more remarkable when water was applied at individual growth stages than at different severities. In contrast, potatoes have been tolerant to both stress timing and severity in total dry matter. These results showed that using deficit irrigation late of the season or with PRD can improve water-saving, minimize yield losses, and consider optimal strategies for drip-irrigated potatoes in the arid regions.},

	abstract = {Decisions in irrigation management can greatly impact the overall sustainability of potato production. A field study was conducted in 2018 and 2019 to evaluate the impacts of different irrigation regimes on yield and quality of three russet potato varieties. For Russet Burbank, fry quality at harvest and at 4 and 8 months after harvest was assessed. During early growth stages, the standard practice of irrigating to maintain 60–80\% soil moisture was employed. The irrigation treatments were applied during the late tuber bulking and maturation growth stages, and consisted of irrigation at 125\%, 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% of daily evapotranspiration (ET). We found that 125\%ET provided no increase in total yield and marketable yield compared to other treatments in 2018, and it produced similar marketable yield to 100\%ET in 2019. Total yield, but not marketable yield, of 125\%ET and 100\%ET was significantly higher than the number under 50\%ET in 2019. In both years, increasing irrigation rate led to a decrease in irrigation efficiency and water-use efficiency. Irrigation rate had no significant effects on tuber quality at harvest and during storage. This study indicated that over-irrigation at 125\%ET was not beneficial to profitable potato production in the Upper Midwest of the US, and deficit irrigation at 75\%ET during late tuber bulking and tuber maturation could potentially result in more sustainable water use while not jeopardizing tuber growth. The results support the possibility of adopting late-season deficit irrigation for growing potatoes in the region, though more years of research would allow for a better understanding of the impacts of this practice.},

Agria) were developed from field experiments in 2007–2008, which were designed to determine the response of tuber yield to no irrigation for two weeks at tuber bulking (TB) and tuber ripening (TR). Deficit-irrigated treatments were compared to a well-irrigated control (C) throughout the growing season. The yield-profit maximization methodology of English (1990) was reviewed and a new procedure based on optimization software was proposed. Treatment with deficit irrigation at TB achieved marketable yield 12\% lower than that obtained in the well-irrigated control (60.5Mgha−1), whereas deficit irrigation at TR reduced tuber yield by 42\%, compared to the control. However, yield reduction was compensated by an increase in tuber dry matter in the deficit-irrigated treatments. The results of the newly proposed yield-profit maximization procedure show that when land is limiting, the level of water applied at which net income per unit of land is maximized (Wl) fits the yield maximizing (Wm) strategy, while when water is limiting, the level of water applied at which net income per unit of water is maximized (Ww) would result in as much water saving as 10–15\% of total applied water. The results also suggest that the target yield that was obtained in the treatment with deficit irrigation at tuber bulking (53.6tha−1) was in the range of 500–560mm of water application. We concluded that deficit irrigation at tuber bulking for two weeks is a suitable scenario for potato farming, with potential benefits resulting from reduced irrigation costs.},

Furthermore, reference values of the irrigation water demand (IWD) were derived. For this purpose, the AgroHyd Farmmodel was used. Calculations were performed within two time periods, 1901–2010 and 2000–2020. The relationships between the traits were detected. The calculations were made for each county of Brandenburg. The water productivity of irrigated potatoes (WPirri) varied between 6.66 and 9.19 kg FM m−3. The irrigation water demand (IWD) of potatoes in each county varied between 173 and 212 mm. In the last 20 years, the trend of the irrigation water demand became positive. Irrigation water seems to be not always able to satisfy the water demand of the potatoes—the yield and, closely associated with the yield, the WPirri decreased. Water productivity of rainfed potatoes (WPnoirri) decreased with increasing precipitation (P). High yields and low water inputs leading to a higher WPnon-irri seem to be not realistic. The high yields during high IWD seemed to be only possible with irrigation. The focus for improving the water productivity has to be put on the large differences in water productivity between the counties. In counties with lower P and lower available water capacity, the increase of irrigation water use to increase WP should be planned carefully.},

	abstract = {Abstract A field study was conducted in four differentially irrigated plots of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) planted in Shiprock sandy loam (coarseloamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplargid) to assess spectral reflectance for estimating the crop coefficient (Kc), defined here as the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration (ET). A bidirectional reflectance factor was measured using a three-channel (0.63 to 0.69 µm, 0.76 to 0.90 µm, and 1.55 to 1.75 µm) handheld radiometer, and was used to calculate a perpendicular vegetation index (PVI). Actual ET was determined by the water balance method in non-weighing lysimeters, and potential ET was calculated using Penman's equation. Significant linear relationships were found between PVI and percent cover (r2 = 0.911), and between Kc and percent cover (r2 = 0.815). In addition, the position of the PVl intersection on the soil background line changed as a result of soil moisture increases following irrigation, even at high percent cover. Thus, once experimental relationships between Kc and crop growth are established, a mean Kc can be determined from spectral estimates of stage of development and the soil background component of PVI can be used to adjust the mean K, for increased evaporation following irrigation because the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration will approach 1 when the soil surface is wet.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT An algorithm was developed to shift the basal crop coefficient (K{\textasciicircum}b) curve with respect to its time axis to obtain a K{\textasciicircum}b in accordance with the real time reflectance-based crop coefficient for corn. Adjustment of the emergence and effective cover dates during vegetative growth made these dates converge on their actual occurrence. Impact of adjustments to the K{\textasciicircum}b curve on irrigation dates was simulated using the USDA-ARS irrigation scheduling model for two seasons. Simulated results for the 1983 growing season showed one or two-day differences in the occurrence of irrigation dates. Prior to effective cover, irrigations occurred earlier for the simulation using feedback (adjusted K{\textasciicircum}b). After effective cover, irrigation dates lagged for the with-feedback simulation compared to the without-feedback simulation. An extra irrigation was required prior to effective cover in 1983 for the simulation using feedback. In 1986, one less irrigation was required for the simulation using feedback to the irrigation scheduling model. This was due to K{\textasciicircum}b curve adjustments that accounted for hail damage and ensuing cool weather that slowed plant growth during early vegetative growth. The first two irrigations were delayed by two and three days, respectively, due to these events for the with-feedback simulation when compared to simulated results obtained not using feedback. Results from the simulation indicated the following: 1) revised or adjusted K{\textasciicircum}b curves derived from spectral inputs are unique to the individual growing season, 2) conventional crop coefficients contribute to underestimation as well as overestimation of crop ET because they cannot account for variable crop growth rates, and 3) adjusting the K{\textasciicircum}b curve in response to actual crop growth allows proper timing of irrigations to ensure that soil moisture conditions are ideal throughout the growing season.},

Therefore, the possibility of directly estimating the crop coefficient from measured reflectance properties of a crop/soil scene was investigated. Reflected canopy radiation in the 0.63 to 0.69 jwm and 0.76 to 0.90 jjim band widths was measured normal to and two meters above corn (Zea mays L.), and the normalized difference (ND) vegetation index was computed. The seasonal ND curve was curvilinear and resembled the basal crop coefficient (K{\textasciicircum}b) curve for corn. Leaf area index and canopy shading were 3.2 and 77.6\%, respectively, when the ND reached its maximum valvue. A linear transformation of the ND was developed by equating the ND at effective cover and for dry, bare soil at the experimental site to the K{\textasciicircum}b at effective cover and for dry soil evaporation, respectively. This transformation produced a seasonal curve very similar to the basal crop coefficient curve and was named the basal spectral crop coefficient (K{\textasciicircum}J. Crop coefficients derived from spectral measurements are independent of the usual time base parameters, planting date and effective cover date, associated with traditional crop coefficients. Thus, the basal spectral crop coefficient is a real-time crop coefficient that permits the crop to express its response to weather, management practices, and stresses.},

In this study, we modified an existing methodology that does not depend on empirical relationships and extended it to derive crop GC from high resolution aerial imagery. Using this procedure, GC is calculated for every pixel in the aerial imagery by dividing the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) of each pixel by the PVI of full canopy. The study was conducted during the summer growing seasons of 2007 and 2008, and involves airborne and ground truth data from 13 agricultural fields in the Southern High Plains of the USA. The results show that the method described in this study can be used to estimate crop GC from high-resolution aerial images with an overall accuracy within 3\% of their true values.},

	abstract = {Crop intelligence and yield prediction of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) are important to farmers and the processing industry. Remote sensing can provide timely information on growth status and accurate yield predictions during the growing season. However, there is limited documentation on the most suitable vegetation indices (VIs) and optimal growth stages for acquiring remote sensing imagery of potato. To address this knowledge gap, a systematic review was conducted. Original scientific manuscripts published between 2000 and 2022 were identified using various databases. The findings indicate that satellite imagery is the most widely used source of remote sensing data for tuber yield prediction, whereas unmanned aerial vehicle systems (UAVs) and handheld sensors are more frequently applied for growth monitoring. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge), green chlorophyll index (CIgreen), and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) are the most frequently used VIs for the growth and yield estimation of potato. The tuber initiation stage was found to be the most appropriate stage for remote sensing data acquisition. This review will assist potato farmers, agronomists and researchers in selecting the most suitable VIs for monitoring specific growth variables and selecting the optimal timing during the growing season to obtain remote sensing images.},

Remote sensing techniques using green canopy cover, leaf area index (LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have been applied to estimate basal crop coefficients (Kcb) and ET for different crops. However, analysis of the potential of these techniques to improve water management in irrigated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is still lacking. This study aimed to assess the modified nonlinear relationship between LAI, Kcb and NDVI in estimating crop coefficients (Kc) and ET of potato. Moreover, Kc and ET were derived from the measured fraction of green canopy cover (FGCC) and the FAO-56 approach. ET estimated from the FAO-56, FGCC and NDVI approaches were compared with the ET simulated using the LINTUL-Potato model. The results showed that the Kc values based on FGCC and NDVI were on average 0.16 lower than values based on FAO-56 Kc during the mid-season growing stage. ET estimated from FAO-56, FGCC and NDVI compared well with ET calculated by the LINTUL-Potato model, with RMSE values of 0.83, 0.79, and 0.78 mm day−1, respectively. These results indicate that dynamic crop coefficients and potato ET can be estimated from canopy cover and NDVI. The outcomes of this study will assist potato growers in determining crop water requirements using real-time ETo, canopy state variables and NDVI data from satellite images.},

	abstract = {Precision agriculture is the application of technologies and principles to manage spatial and temporal variability associated with all aspects of agricultural production for the purpose of improving crop performance and environmental quality. Success in precision agriculture is related to how well it can be applied to assess, manage, and evaluate the space-time continuum in crop production. This theme is used here to assess the current and potential capabilities of precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is technology enabled. It is through the integration of specific technologies that the potential is created to assess and manage variability at levels of detail never before obtainable and, when done correctly, at levels of quality never before achieved. The agronomic feasibility of precision agriculture has been intuitive, depending largely on the application of traditional management recommendations at finer scales, although new approaches are appearing. The agronomic success of precision agriculture has been limited and inconsistent although quite convincing in some cases, such as N management in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Our analysis suggests prospects for current precision management increase as the degree of spatial dependence increases, but the degree of difficulty in achieving precision management increases with temporal variance. Thus, management parameters with high spatial dependence and low temporal variance (e.g., liming, P, and K) will be more easily managed precisely than those with large temporal variance (e.g., mobile insects). The potential for economic, environmental, and social benefits of precision agriculture is complex and largely unrealized because the space-time continuum of crop production has not been adequately addressed.},

Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications.},

Irrigation was supplied during the 2021 growing season on a loamy sand site in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania, Germany. Yield and tuber quality of the high-amylopectin potato (HAPP) variety “Waxy/Henriette” were assessed in a three-grade tuber size distribution. Five economic indicators were used to assess the suitability of the investigated irrigation levels to secure economic responses. Yield and starch yield did not significantly differ between the 90\% (561.1 dt ha−1 and 102.0 dt ha−1) and the 100\% irrigation levels (559.1 dt ha−1 and 102.3 dt ha−1), with total production increasing by 2.0 dt ha−1 and starch production decreasing by 0.4 dt ha−1 at the 90\% irrigation level. Tuber lesions decreased the economic responses at all irrigation levels. Potentially, 87,469 m3 of irrigation water (125.8 m3 ha−1) could have been saved on the loamy sand starch potato sites of the local farm (695.3 ha) in 2021.},

Meanwhile, globally, most of the available freshwater resources are utilized for irrigation purposes in agriculture. Currently, many world regions are facing extreme water shortage problems, which can worsen if not managed properly. In the literature, numerous methods and remedies are used to cope with the increasing global water crises. The use of precision irrigation water-saving systems (PISs) for efficient water management under climate change is one of them and is a highly recommended approach by researchers. It can mitigate the adverse effects of changing climate and help enhance water use efficiency, crop yield, and environmental footprints. Thus, the present study aimed to comprehensively examine and review PISs, focusing on their development, implementation, and positive impacts on sustainable water management. In addition, we searched the literature using different online search engines and reviewed and summarized the main results of the previously published papers on PISs. We discussed the traditional irrigation method and its modernization for enhancing water use efficiency, PIS monitoring and controlling, architecture, data sharing communication technologies, the role of artificial intelligence for irrigation water-saving, and the future prospects of the PIS. Based on the brief literature review, the present study concluded that the future of PISs seems bright, driven by the need for efficient irrigation water management systems, technological advancements, and increasing environmental awareness. As the water scarcity problem intensifies due to climate change and population growth, the PIS is poised to play a critical role in optimizing and modernizing water usage, increasing water use efficiency, and reducing environmental footprints, thus ensuring sustainable agriculture development.},

To this end, we tested and validated a novel leaf sensor (Leaf Water Meter, LWM), based on the photon attenuation during the passage of the light through the leaf, to monitor plant water status. Four woody species were subjected to multiple cycles of dehydration and re-hydration, and the signals recorded by the LWM were compared with classical measurements of plant water relations (relative water content and water potential). A good agreement between the signals recorded by LWM sensor and the destructive measurements, throughout the repeated water stress and rewatering cycles, was found across all species. These results demonstrate that LWM sensor is a sensitive, non-destructive and easy-to-handle device to reliably monitor in continuous fashion leaf water status. In conclusion, this sensor may be considered a promising tool for smart irrigation scheduling in precision agriculture context to decrease water wastage in light of global change and increasing conflicts over water demand.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the Arable Mark 2 sensor, an automated and low-cost radiometer, for its potential to retrieve surface reflectance data and validate orbital sensors such as the Landsat-8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) Level 2 product. While orbital sensors are widely used for monitoring solar radiation changes, managing natural resources, and understanding climatic trends, atmospheric effects can make it challenging to obtain accurate measurements. Equipped with multiple sensors, including long-wave and short-wave radiometers, the Arable Mark 2 sensor can measure upwelling and downwelling irradiance to calculate surface reflectance. To assess the accuracy and consistency of the Arable Mark 2 sensor, the study performed a cross-calibration using a ground truth measurement collected with the Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) as the reference point. Additionally, a spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) was applied across the calibrated Arable surface reflectance to compare it against the orbital sensor. An automated library aided in calculating SBAF for the days with unavailable hyperspectral data. The study found that the Arable Mark 2 sensor can provide accurate surface reflectance data that can be used for orbital sensor validation. The Arable sensor was successfully calibrated against the ASD FieldSpec with an average difference of less than 1/10 reflectance unit (reflectance unit = 0.01) for the blue, green, yellow, and red bands. The red-edge and NIR-1 bands showed an average difference of less than 1/2 reflectance units, while the NIR-2 band had an average difference of less than 1/10 reflectance unit of calibration accuracy. The calibrated Arable surface reflectance data was then compared against orbital sensor surface reflectance data, and the results showed good agreement between the two datasets. The study concludes that the low-cost and automated nature of the Arable Mark 2 sensor makes it a promising tool for surface reflectance retrieval and orbital sensor validation.},
